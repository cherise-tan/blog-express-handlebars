            The <code>position</code> property defines the method used to display an element on a webpage.
            It allows you to place elements (e.g. text, pictures, video) where you want them.
            Each element on a website is actually a rectangular block, and this property allows you to define how these
            blocks will appear on the page.
            Elements are positioned using the properties of <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>right</code>
            and <code>left</code>.

        <h3 class="title is-5 padding-0">Relative Positioning</h3>
        <p class="padding-0">
            Relative positioning allows you to move an element from its current position.
            It is important to note that relative means <em>relative to itself</em>.
            If you set an element to be <code>position: relative;</code> without any positioning elements (top, bottom,
            left or right), the position will not change.
        </p>
        <p class="padding-2">
            An important thing to note about positioning properties is that they will actually push the block
            <em>away</em> from the specified direction. For example: <code>red-item { position: relative; top: 20px;
                }</code> will push the block
            20px <em>down</em> from where it would normally sit. The space which the element previously occupied will
            not be filled by another element.

        <h3 class="title is-5 padding-0">Absolute Positioning</h3>
        <p class="padding-0">
            Absolute positioning allows you to set the elements position relative to the next <em>parent</em> element.
            If there is no such parent element, it will default to the <code>html</code> element - meaning it will be
            placed relative to the page itself. An important thing to consider with this is that the element will
            therefore be removed from the flow of the document; it will no longer be affected by any other elements on
            the page. The space which the element previously occupied will be filled by another element.
        </p>
        <p class="padding-2">
            For example: <code>red-item { position: absolute, top: 20px; }</code> will push the red element 20px down
            from its blue <em>parent</em> element.

        <h3 class="title is-5 padding-0">Fixed Positioning</h3>
        <p class="padding-0">
            Fixed positioning allows you to place an element relative to the browser window (also known as the
            viewport). It allows you to fix an element in place so that it will not move as the user scrolls through the
            page. An example of this would be a navigation bar that stays at the top of the browser window, even as the
            user scrolls down the page. This will also remove this element from the flow of the document, allowing other
            elements to fill the space that it previously occupied.
